It's highly desired that all commands exist as distinct codes in the CommandCode. The only exceptions 
to that rule as of this writing is GetMetaData and Metadata. This is because each command is sent by itself 
and processed one at a time. 

When requesting metadata, It's necessary to put all requests in the same packet if synchronizing a large database, 
otherwise, the response could be from different versions of the database, which would make management more difficult.

When responding metadata, it's possible the response could be hundreds of MBs or more, Therefore, it's unreasonable
to assume that the metadata can be placed in a single packet. Therefore fragmenting the metadata response is permitted.
